b. the locality increases as we change the alorithm to access the data in a more optimal order. We can see this as each algorithm reports a slower or faster time depending on the matrix size	

c. Yes!!!!

d. Yes. They have likely already optimized the locality and have to seek other means of reaching higher efficiency
