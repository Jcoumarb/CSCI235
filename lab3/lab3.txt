What is happening between points  A - B is a necessary location change because the original 'array' reached max capacity.
A new mem location called 'Bigger' is made, copies the data of 'array', swaps handles, and then bigger is freed.
fucntionally allowing 'array' to be larger and hold the same data in a new larger location under the same name

when resize_attempt.c is compiled and ran without a command line argument, it gives a segmentation fault error.
This is the result because without parameter, the entire argv array is null except for argv[0] holding the file name.
this results in the atoi(argv[1]) blowing up because it is called on null.
